In this section, I will be showing you how to install and setup Enrich add-on for Blender. Enrich add-on can be installed just like any other add-on, but it is a bit different because of the Presets that come with it. Therefore it is a good idea to properly watch the video incase you have some problems with installation of the add-on.


## Installation

- First **Download the add-on file** from your [Gumroad account](https://www.gumroad.com/library) or [Blender Market account](https://blendermarket.com/account).
- **Extract** the add-on zip file.
- Then go to **Blender > User Preferences > Addons > Install from file**, and select the - file which ends with **'_Install.zip'**.
- Enable the add-on and click **'Install All the Presets'** button.
