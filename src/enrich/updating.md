# Updating Enrich add-on

In this video I will be showing you how to Update and Uninstalling the add-on. The Enrich add-on comes with a feature of Custom Presets. When you remove the Enrich add-on, these presets would also be deleted. But with Enrich, I have kept this in mind and created the Export Presets feature which will create a .zip file of all the presets installed in the add-on.

## Steps to export the add-on presets

- File > User Preferences > Addons> Enrich Add-on > Export Options.
- **Select the directory** to save the exported presets .zip file.
- Then Click `Export Presets` button. This would **take time** depending on the number of presets in the add-on.
- The Preset file will be **saved with the date** when exported.
- The **old add-on can then be removed**, and the new add-on can be installed just like the way you installed the add-on for the first time.
**NOTE**: Make sure to install the exported presets as well in the add-on.
