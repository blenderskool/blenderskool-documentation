In this video I will be showing you how to Install Custom Presets in the Enrich add-on. Custom Presets are one of those amazing features of the Enrich add-on which allows you to Install Custom Presets in the add-on. So once installed, you can use your presets just as any other preset in any scene.

## Steps to Install custom presets

- Start by opening a new scene in Blender, and **create your NodeGroup (Preset)**.
- Open the Properties Panel (N key) and select the NodeGroup name in the `NodeGroup` Field.
- Then Press `Install Preset` button. Then select a `.png` icon for the preset.
- The Preset **should be installed** and you can see it in the **Presets menu** of the Enrich add-on.
