In this video I will be showing you some of the post processing options in the Enrich add-on. The Enrich add-on comes with a wide variety of post production options to allow you to add effects just as you want. Every setting is divided into boxes which can be accessed separately. The Enrich add-on also comes with two interface options: ‘Simple’ for quick effects and beginner friendly, ‘Advanced’ for serious control over all the effects.
