In this video I will be showing you all the User Preferences Setting of the Kaleidoscope add-on in Blender.There are a few settings that come with the Kaleidoscope add-on which are other utitility options to improve your experience.


## Options

### Import files
This option would allow you to install a **.zip** or **.kal** file in the add-on. It can be used to install the previously exported files as well.

### Export files
This option would allow you to export a **.zip** or **.kal** file which holds all your saved palettes and values to a specified directory. It can be used as a backup in case you delete some of your files later.

### Path to sync
This option allows you to select the path where you would want to sync your saved palettes and values. To understand how to setup syncing, [watch this article](/kaleidoscope/setup-syncing.html).

### Check for Kaleidoscope update
This button would allow you to check and install Kaleidoscope add-on updates automatically.
