In this video, I will be showing you how to use the Intensity node of the Kaleidocope add-on in Blender. The Intensity node is created to provide you with a library of pre-defined values that can be used with your materials in your scene. So if you are creating a Glass material, and looking for the correct IOR value, you can use the Intensity node to find it out. All the values come with a common name, which makes it even easier to unserstand.


## Categories in the node

### Glass IOR
The IOR (Index of Refraction) value, is the ratio between speed of light ray in vacuum to the speed in the medium. So, the IOR value defines that how much slower a light ray would travel in a medium compared to that in vacuum. This value is important and it controls the refractions caused by the light ray.

### Blackbody
A Blackbody radiator radiates light, with a specific temperature, and this temperature defines a specific hue to that light ray. This characteristic of light is important in the fields of Photography, Lighting, and many more.

### Custom
This category is for you to save some custom values to be used in the future through the node.
